# SQL-Review-and-Learning

I think SQL is an essential technical skill for everyone who want to become data analyst.  
So I installed MySQL in my computer, do some practices, improve my SQL skill and update my learning here.  

N.B. 

1. The queries I used are just for **MySQL**, maybe they won't work in other DBMS like SQL server, Access, PostgreSQL...
2. The dataset I use is from [here]('forta.com/books/0672336073/')
3. I made a relational schema of the dataset I used and put it here. I think it's really helpful for understanding the dataset structure.
